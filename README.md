# Credit_Risk_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning by training and evaluating models to assess credit card risk for LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.

* The dataset was oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. 
* The dataset was then over- and undersampling (combination of the techniques) using the SMOTEENN algorithm. 
* BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, the machine learning models that reduce bias,  were used to predict credit risk.
