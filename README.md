# Credit_Risk_Analysis
The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning by training and evaluating models to assess credit card risk for LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.

### Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
#### RandomOverSampler, SMOTE and ClusterCentroids algorithms
* The dataset was oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
